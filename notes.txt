commands

touch "filename.filetype" = create a new file
git add filename.filetype = add to repo
git commit -m "comment / notes" = commit to repo
git log = see recent commits
git diff = compare different versions

git commits have 3 parts
1. commit
    - contains the metadata - author, log message,  commit time
2. tree
    - tracks the names and locations of files and directories in the repo
    - mapping keys to files/directories
3. blob
    - binary large object
    - may contain data of any kind
    - compressed snapshot of a file's content

GIT LOG
- can restrict or put conditions which log you want to see
    ex. git log "readme.md"
        git log -2 readme.md -> two recent commits
        git log --since='Month Day Year' -> customizing date range
        git log --since='Month Day Year' --until='Month Day Year' -> customizing date range
            recommended: YYYY-MM-DD, can use: "2 years ago", "yesterday"
